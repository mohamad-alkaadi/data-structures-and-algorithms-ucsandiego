the idea is: we genrate some random test than we launch two solutions and we compare the result
if the answer is the same on both then both the solutions are correct
and if the answer differ that mean one is correct and one is not 
and if both are wrong ths mean that each one is worng in a deffrent way
and you fix the bug and then run the strees test again
