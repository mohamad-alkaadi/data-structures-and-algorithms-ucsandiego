To solve the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, you can use this simple formula:

LCM(𝑎,𝑏) = (𝑎*𝑏) / GCD(𝑎,𝑏)

Here's how it works:
GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is the largest number that divides both a and b.

Once you find the GCD, divide the product of a and b by it to get the LCM.
