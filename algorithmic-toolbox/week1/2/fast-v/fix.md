to fix the slowness of the code we scan the the array two time to finde the largest number


The goal is to find the maximum pairwise product, which is simply:

max product = largest number × second largest number
These two numbers can be anywhere in the array.

They do not need to be next to each other (i.e., consecutive).

What matters is their value, not their position.
