the Maximum Pairwise Product problem
In this problem: we're given an array, or a sequence of non negative n numbers (integers). 

our goal: is to find a number which can be obtained by multiplying some two distinct numbers from this sequence.

input format: 
first line: an integer 𝑛 (number of elements) where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
the next line: 𝑛 non-negative integers 0 <= a0, a1, ....., an-1 <= 10^5

output format:
output a single number --- the maximum pairwise product

example 1:
    input:
        3
        1 2 3
    output:
        6
example 2:
    input:
        10
        7 5 14 2 8 8 10 1 2 3
    output:
        140
